We've launched a crowdfunding campaign at http://fundrazr.com/theholygrail. The crowdfunding campain is titled Miracles of The Holy Spirit. We have complimentary art we have given variable strategic names of God's Fingerprint or The Harps of God to appease both science and religious aspirated folk. Furthermore, Good Faith Paradigm bases the name of it's campaign on two images that we have created a pair of medallions from. Our assets are sacred and be used for cognitive behavior therapy, propritary sales methods and nominal inspiration events. 

We are currently exploring development options to create technology soltuions that are complimentary to our physical assests.
